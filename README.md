#Chess
This is the classic game of grand strategy, written in Ruby and played from the terminal. The game is played by two human players. Future goals include pitting a human player against an AI, improving the visual appeal of the board and pieces along with improving the UI.

###Installing and Playing
Download the repository. From the terminal, navigate to:

```
chess/lib
```


Run the command:

```
